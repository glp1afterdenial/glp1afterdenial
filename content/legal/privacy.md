## The Short Version

I don't collect much data. This is a personal blog, not a data company. Here's what happens when you visit:

## What I Collect

**Automatically (via hosting):**
- Basic analytics (page views, general location by country)
- Standard server logs (IP addresses, browser type)

**If you email me:**
- Your email address and message content

**That's it.** No accounts, no tracking cookies, no selling your data.

## Third-Party Services

**Netlify (hosting):** Handles basic server functions. See their [privacy policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/).

**Amazon Associates:** If you click an Amazon affiliate link, Amazon handles that transaction and their privacy policy applies.

**Other affiliate programs:** Similar deal — once you click to a partner site, their privacy policy applies.

## Cookies

This site uses minimal cookies:
- Essential cookies for site functionality

- No cross-site tracking

## Your Rights

You can:
- Email me to ask what data I have about you (probably nothing)
- Ask me to delete any data I have
- Opt out of any emails (just reply and ask)
