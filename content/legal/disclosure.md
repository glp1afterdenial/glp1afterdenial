## The Honest Truth

This site contains affiliate links. When you click them and make a purchase, I may earn a small commission at **no extra cost to you**.

## What That Means

If I link to a product or service and you buy it, the company pays me a referral fee. You pay the same price either way.

## Who I'm Affiliated With

**Amazon Associates:** Links to supplies like syringes, bacteriostatic water, sharps containers, etc.

**Peptide Suppliers:** When I recommend specific vendors, I may earn a commission if you purchase through my link.

**Telehealth Platforms:** Some telehealth services have referral programs.

## My Promise

1. **I only recommend things I've actually used** or thoroughly researched
2. **Affiliate relationships don't influence my opinions** — I'll tell you if something sucks
3. **I'll always disclose** when a link is an affiliate link
4. **Your trust matters more than commissions** — I'd rather have readers who trust me than make a quick buck

## Why Affiliate Links?

Running a website costs money (hosting, domain, time). Affiliate income helps offset those costs and lets me keep creating free content.

If you find this site helpful and want to support it, using my affiliate links is an easy way to do that. But no pressure — I appreciate you being here either way.
