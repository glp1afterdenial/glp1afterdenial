<h4 style="margin: 0 0 12px 0; color: #92400e;">⚠️ The Problem No One Talks About</h4>
<p style="margin: 0; color: #78350f; line-height: 1.6;">GLP-1 medications cause significant weight loss — but <strong>25-40% of that weight can be muscle</strong>, not fat. If you're active or care about body composition, this matters.</p>
</div>

## The Muscle Loss Problem

Every GLP-1 causes some muscle loss. It's unavoidable when you're in a calorie deficit. But how much muscle you lose varies by medication:

| Medication | Total Weight Loss | Lean Mass Loss | Fat Mass Loss |
|------------|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Semaglutide** | ~15-17% | ~39% of loss | ~61% of loss |
| **Tirzepatide** | ~20-22% | ~25% of loss | ~75% of loss |
| **Retatrutide** | ~24% | ~33% of loss | ~67% of loss |

*Data from JAMA viewpoint analysis of Phase 2/3 trials*

**Translation:** If you lose 50 lbs on semaglutide, roughly 20 lbs could be muscle. On tirzepatide, it's closer to 12-13 lbs. 

That's a meaningful difference — especially if you're lifting or doing CrossFit.

## Why Retatrutide May Be Different

Retatrutide is the first **triple agonist** — it targets GLP-1, GIP, *and* glucagon receptors. That third receptor is key for muscle preservation.

<div style="background: #f0fdf4; border-radius: 12px; padding: 20px;">
<h4 style="margin: 0 0 12px 0; color: #15803d;">What Glucagon Does</h4>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 20px; color: #166534; font-size: 0.95rem;">
<li>Increases energy expenditure</li>
<li>Promotes fat oxidation</li>
<li>Prioritizes fat as fuel (not muscle)</li>
<li>Enhances metabolic flexibility</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div style="background: #eff6ff; border-radius: 12px; padding: 20px;">
<h4 style="margin: 0 0 12px 0; color: #1e40af;">Why This Matters</h4>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 20px; color: #1e3a8a; font-size: 0.95rem;">
<li>Body burns more calories at rest</li>
<li>Fat is used for energy, sparing muscle</li>
<li>Better body composition, not just weight loss</li>
<li>Maintains strength during deficit</li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>

Semaglutide only suppresses appetite — you eat less, but your body doesn't burn more. Retatrutide does both: **eat less AND burn more**.

## The Research

A recent meta-analysis in *ScienceDirect* found that higher-dose semaglutide and tirzepatide were actually the **least effective** at preserving lean mass, despite being the most effective for total weight loss.

The only GLP-1 that showed significant weight loss *without* significant lean mass reduction was liraglutide — but it only produces ~6-8% weight loss, which isn't enough for most people.

**Retatrutide's advantage:** Early data suggests the glucagon receptor activation increases resting metabolic rate and fat oxidation, which may help the body preferentially burn fat instead of breaking down muscle for energy.

## My Experience

I recently switched to retatrutide after being on semaglutide. My main reason? **Muscle preservation.**

With CrossFit being a big part of my routine, I was worried about losing the strength I'd built. The glucagon component of retatrutide theoretically helps maintain lean mass during weight loss — and that mattered to me.

So far, the side effects have been about the same as semaglutide. Nothing worse. I'll update this as I go.

## What Actually Preserves Muscle

No matter which GLP-1 you use, these factors matter more than the medication itself:

### 1. Protein Intake

<div style="background: #fef2f2; border-radius: 12px; padding: 20px; margin: 24px 0;">
<h4 style="margin: 0 0 12px 0; color: #dc2626;">🎯 Target: 1.6-2.2g protein per kg body weight</h4>
<p style="margin: 0; color: #991b1b;">That's roughly <strong>0.7-1g per pound</strong>. For a 180lb person, aim for 130-180g protein daily.</p>
</div>

A case series published in *PMC* followed three patients who prioritized protein (1.6-2.3g/kg relative to fat-free mass) during GLP-1 treatment. Results:
- One lost only 8.7% of weight as lean mass
- Two actually **gained** lean mass while losing fat

**The key:** Even when you're not hungry, eat protein. GLP-1s crush appetite, but your muscles still need fuel.

### 2. Resistance Training

The same case series showed patients doing resistance training 3-5 days/week preserved significantly more muscle than typical trial participants.

**Minimum effective dose:**
- 2-3 resistance sessions per week
- Hit each muscle group twice
- Progressive overload (gradually increase weight/reps)

### 3. Slower Titration

Rapid weight loss = more muscle loss. Going slower gives your body time to adapt.

Instead of rushing to max dose:
- Stay at each dose 4-6 weeks (not 4)
- Only increase if weight loss stalls
- Consider staying at a moderate dose long-term

## Which GLP-1 Should You Choose?

<div style="background: #f8fafc; border-radius: 12px; padding: 24px; margin: 24px 0;">

**Choose semaglutide if:**
- You're new to GLP-1s
- You want FDA-approved medication
- Muscle preservation isn't your top priority
- Budget is a concern

**Choose tirzepatide if:**
- You want better body composition than semaglutide
- You can get a prescription or source research peptides
- You've tried semaglutide and want more results

**Choose retatrutide if:**
- Muscle preservation is a priority
- You're active (lifting, CrossFit, etc.)
- You've plateaued on other GLP-1s
- You're comfortable with research peptides (not FDA-approved)

## My Ranking for Muscle Preservation

Based on mechanism and available data:

<div style="display: grid; gap: 12px; margin: 24px 0;">

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fef3c7 0%, #fde68a 100%); border: 2px solid #f59e0b; border-radius: 12px; padding: 20px;">
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 12px;">
<span style="background: #f59e0b; color: white; padding: 4px 12px; border-radius: 6px; font-weight: 700;">1st</span>
<div>
<div style="font-weight: 700; color: #92400e;">Retatrutide</div>
<div style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #a16207;">Triple agonist with glucagon = increased fat oxidation, potential muscle sparing</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div style="background: #f8fafc; border: 2px solid #e2e8f0; border-radius: 12px; padding: 20px;">
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 12px;">
<span style="background: #64748b; color: white; padding: 4px 12px; border-radius: 6px; font-weight: 700;">2nd</span>
<div>
<div style="font-weight: 700; color: #0f172a;">Tirzepatide</div>
<div style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #64748b;">Dual agonist with better lean mass preservation than semaglutide (25% vs 39%)</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div style="background: #f8fafc; border: 2px solid #e2e8f0; border-radius: 12px; padding: 20px;">
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 12px;">
<span style="background: #94a3b8; color: white; padding: 4px 12px; border-radius: 6px; font-weight: 700;">3rd</span>
<div>
<div style="font-weight: 700; color: #0f172a;">Semaglutide</div>
<div style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #64748b;">Single agonist, highest lean mass loss as percentage of total weight</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

**Important caveat:** Your protein intake and resistance training matter more than which GLP-1 you pick. Someone doing everything right on semaglutide will preserve more muscle than someone on retatrutide who's not eating enough protein.

## The Bottom Line

All GLP-1s cause some muscle loss. But you can minimize it by:

1. **Eating enough protein** (130-180g/day for most people)
2. **Resistance training** (2-3x/week minimum)
3. **Choosing the right GLP-1** (retatrutide or tirzepatide > semaglutide for body composition)
4. **Going slower** (don't rush to max dose)

If you're active and care about maintaining muscle, retatrutide's glucagon component offers a theoretical advantage. It's why I made the switch.
